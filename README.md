# Data Mining - Hüseyin Yaşar

This project applies data mining methods to analyze and model different datasets. It includes tasks like classification, clustering, and regression.

## Project Topics

1. **Classification:** 
   - **Dataset:** Iris
   - **Goal:** Classify flower species based on leaf features.
   - **Algorithms:**
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
   - **Results:**
     - Decision Tree achieved 91.11% accuracy.
     - Random Forest achieved 88.89% accuracy.

2. **Clustering:**
   - **Dataset:** Mall Customers
   - **Goal:** Segment customers based on income and spending score.
   - **Algorithm:** K-Means
   - **Methods to Choose Optimal Clusters:**
     - Elbow Method
     - Silhouette Score
   - **Results:**
     - 4 clusters were selected as optimal.

3. **Regression:**
   - **Dataset:** Real Estate Valuation
   - **Goal:** Predict real estate prices based on features.
   - **Algorithms:**
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge Regression
     - Lasso Regression
   - **Results:**
     - Ridge and Lasso models performed better with lower error values.
